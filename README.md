# Random-Password-Generator--Using Python

## Project Overview:
This Python-based project allows users to generate secure, customizable passwords. The program takes user input for various criteria, including password length and the types of characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols), and generates a random password based on those preferences.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, secure password generation tool that ensures randomness and incorporates user preferences. The tool helps users create strong passwords for online accounts or any other secure login system.

## Features:
- Choose password length.
- Select character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- Specify custom characters or choose random ones.
- Generates a secure, randomized password.

## Technology Used:
- Python 3.x
- random and string libraries

## Working:
1. The user inputs their name, desired password length, and character preferences.
2. The program ensures at least one character from each selected type is included.
3. It generates the password by shuffling characters for randomness.

## Result:
A secure, randomly generated password based on the user's criteria.


## How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.
